CensorNow is a smart video editing tool that helps you quickly mute or beep out inappropriate, offensive, or private content from your videos.

It works in two modes:

Automatic Mode: Uses the built-in profanity detector to automatically identify and censor offensive language.

Custom Mode: Lets you review the video transcript and manually select specific words or phrases you want to censor.

With CensorNow, you can make your videos safer and more shareable without the hassle of manual editing.
